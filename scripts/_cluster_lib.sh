# The key idea: the MASTER (rank 0) is whichever listed host IS this machine, and
# it must NOT SSH to itself. mpirun launches the local rank by fork, not SSH, and
# a master typically has no passwordless SSH to its own name. So every per-node
# action checks is_local() first and runs locally for the master, SSH otherwise.
#
# Locality is detected purely by IDENTITY (hostname + bound IPs, and resolving
# each alias back to an IP), NOT by argument order. That way the same hostfile is
# correct no matter which node launches, and a misconfigured alias (e.g. 'node1'
# pointed at the master's IP) is exposed by the callers instead of silently
# building a cluster of clones.
#
# Callers set NODE_USER (bare username, no @) before sourcing; we normalise it.

# Bare login user (may be empty) and the user@ prefix for SSH.

# purely by identity now (see is_local), so the topology is correct no matter
# which node you launch from, and a misconfigured alias is exposed not masked.
