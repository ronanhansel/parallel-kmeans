# Bring every node to the same code + binary before a cluster run.
#
# mpirun execs ./bin/kmeans_mpi at the SAME relative path on every host, so a
# stale binary on any slave silently breaks the run (classic symptom: four
# "P=1" lines instead of one "P=<total>" — the binary was linked against a
# different MPI runtime; see docs/RUNBOOK / handoff "singleton bug").
#
# This script brings each host in the hostfile to the same commit + a freshly
# linked binary by running, in the repo:
#     git pull --ff-only   (skip with NO_PULL=1)
#     make clean && make
#
# The MASTER (rank 0, wherever this runs) is built LOCALLY — it never SSHes to
# itself. Only the other nodes are reached over SSH.
#
# The hostfile is the single source of truth for cluster membership — add the
# 3rd/4th node there (via make_hostfile.sh) and it's picked up automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync_nodes.sh
#   HOSTFILE=hosts.txt NODE_USER=mpi scripts/sync_nodes.sh
#   REPO_DIR=parallel-kmeans-mpi scripts/sync_nodes.sh
#   NO_PULL=1 scripts/sync_nodes.sh        # just rebuild, don't git pull
